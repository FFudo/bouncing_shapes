# Bevy Test Project

This is just a small Bevy test project to get familiar with the engine and ECS.

The idea is to create some random shapes and let them move around randomly. I'll add collision detection with themselves and the walls. I might also extend the project by adding shaders on impact. Let's see how it goes!
